Weekend badminton fixture generator
We are a large group of people play badminton over weekend. The challenge is to come up with doubles fixtures with evenly balanced teams with multiple courts and multiple modes. Rightnow restricted to only doubles with multiple courts. So the idea is to generate non overlaping balanced teams/players so teams can play at the same time in multiple courts.
